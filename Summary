### Summary: Task 4 – Setup and Use a Firewall on Windows

This task focuses on understanding and applying basic firewall rules to control network traffic on Windows systems. 
Firewalls are critical components in cybersecurity, acting as gatekeepers that filter traffic based on predefined rules.

#### Windows Firewall

- **Tool Used**: Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security
- **Steps**:
  1. Open the firewall tool using `wf.msc` or via Control Panel.
  2. Navigate to **Inbound Rules** to view existing configurations.
  3. Create a new rule to **block TCP port 23** (Telnet), which is commonly disabled due to its lack of encryption.
  4. Test the rule using `telnet localhost 23`—connection should fail.
  5. Delete the rule to restore the original state.

#### Key Concepts

- **Inbound vs Outbound Rules**: Inbound rules control traffic entering the system; outbound rules control traffic leaving.
- **Port Filtering**: Specific ports (e.g., 22 for SSH, 23 for Telnet) can be allowed or blocked to manage access.
- **Stateful Inspection**: Firewalls track the state of connections to make intelligent filtering decisions.
- **Security Implication**: Blocking insecure services like Telnet enhances system security.
